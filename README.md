# HOW-TO-PROVISION-EC2-INSTANCE
In this lab, I demonstrate how to properly provision an EC2 instance in order to run Windows services. 
After loggingg into AWS, navigate to EC2 on the search bar. That will direct you to the page to begin creating your virtual machine.
Once you are directed to the EC2 page, select "Launch instance". 
After selecting "Launch instance", you will be directed to a page in which you are able to choose the type of operating system you are trying to create.
I chose Windows as my operating system since I am looking to provision an EC2 instance purposely for Active Directory. 
Leave everything as default except for the instance type. Here you will choose the right cpu and memory so that the instance can operate smoothly once connected. 
Create a key pair in order to decrypt the password to connect to the virtual machine. Then, scroll to the bottom and select "Launch Instance".
Click on the hyperlink of the ID of the instance and there you will see that the virtual machine is initializing. Once initialization is complete you are able to begin connecting to the instance.
