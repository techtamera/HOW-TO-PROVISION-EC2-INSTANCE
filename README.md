# HOW-TO-PROVISION-EC2-INSTANCE
In this lab, I demonstrate how to properly provision an EC2 instance in order to run Windows services. 
After loggingg into AWS, navigate to EC2 on the search bar. That will direct you to the page to begin creating your virtual machine.
Once you are directed to the EC2 page, click on "create instance" 
After clicking "create instance", you will be directed to a page in which you are able to choose the type of operating system you are trying to create.
